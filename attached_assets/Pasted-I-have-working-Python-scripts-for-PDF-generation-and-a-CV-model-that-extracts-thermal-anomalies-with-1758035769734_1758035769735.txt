I have working Python scripts for PDF generation and a CV model that extracts thermal anomalies with location data. I have DJI Cloud API access. I need a Next.js wrapper to let pilots upload images, run them through my existing pipeline, and deliver reports. What's the minimal integration path?"

Technical Communication with Engineers
What to Tell Your Engineers
The Core Message:
"We're building a thin Next.js frontend that triggers existing Python services. Don't rebuild anything - just orchestrate what we have."
Specific Technical Requirements:
javascript// This is what you need - a simple pipeline
1. Upload endpoint â†’ S3
2. Trigger Python service (already built)
3. Store results in Postgres
4. Serve PDF from S3 signed URL
Fastest Path to Test Scenario (2-3 Days)
Day 1: Basic Upload Flow
typescript// pages/api/upload.ts
- Multipart upload to S3
- Queue job in Redis/BullMQ
- Return job ID

// pages/upload.tsx
- Dropzone component
- Progress bar
- Job status polling
Day 2: Python Integration
typescript// pages/api/process.ts
export async function POST(req) {
  const { s3Keys } = req.body;
  
  // Just call your existing Python service
  const response = await fetch('http://your-python-service:8000/process', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ 
      images: s3Keys,
      include_pins: true  // for validation
    })
  });
  
  return response.json();
}
Day 3: Results Display
typescript// Simple results page
- Show PDF download link
- Display pin locations on map
- Compare CV results vs manual pins
Integration Difficulty: It's Actually Easy
Your Python integration is straightforward because you already have the hard parts done:
Option 1: Direct HTTP (Simplest)
javascript// In Next.js API route
const runPythonCV = async (imageUrls) => {
  // Your Python service running on port 8000
  return fetch('http://localhost:8000/analyze', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ images: imageUrls })
  });
}
Option 2: Docker Compose (Most Reliable)
yaml# docker-compose.yml
services:
  nextjs:
    build: .
    ports: ["3000:3000"]
  
  python-cv:
    build: ./python-service
    ports: ["8000:8000"]
  
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
Option 3: Serverless (If you want to scale)
javascript// Use AWS Lambda for Python scripts
import { Lambda } from 'aws-sdk';
const lambda = new Lambda();

const result = await lambda.invoke({
  FunctionName: 'cv-processor',
  Payload: JSON.stringify({ imageUrl })
}).promise();
What You DON'T Need Right Now
Skip these for your test:

Authentication (use basic auth or magic links)
Payment processing
Complex dashboards
Job matching algorithm
Email notifications

Exact Engineer Instructions
Tell your engineer this:

"Build a Next.js app with three pages:

/upload - Drag-drop images, show upload progress
/api/process - Receives S3 URLs, calls Python service at http://python-cv:8000/process, returns job ID
/results/[id] - Shows PDF download and pin comparison map

The Python service is already built and returns:
json{
  "pdf_url": "s3://...",
  "anomalies": [
    {"lat": 30.1, "lng": -97.2, "type": "hotspot", "confidence": 0.92}
  ]
}
Just wire it up. Use Vercel's Edge Functions to call Python, store results in Postgres, show on a map."

For Your DJI Integration
Since you have the API already:
javascript// This is all you need
const getDJIPins = async (flightId) => {
  // Your existing DJI Cloud API
  const pins = await fetch(`https://api.dji.com/flights/${flightId}/pins`, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${DJI_TOKEN}` }
  });
  return pins.json();
}

// Compare with CV results
const validateAccuracy = (cvAnomalies, djiPins) => {
  // Simple distance calculation
  return cvAnomalies.map(anomaly => {
    const nearestPin = findNearest(anomaly, djiPins);
    return {
      ...anomaly,
      validatedBy: nearestPin,
      distance: haversine(anomaly, nearestPin)
    };
  });
}
The Reality Check
You could have a working test system this week if you:

Use NextJS API routes as a proxy to your Python service (don't rewrite anything)
Deploy Python service to Railway.app or Fly.io (literally one command)
Use Uploadthing or Presigned S3 URLs for uploads
Show results with react-leaflet (simpler than Mapbox for testing)

The integration isn't hard at all - it's just HTTP calls between services. Your Python script doesn't care if it's called from Next.js or anywhere else.
Bottom line for engineers: "We have working Python services. Build a Next.js UI that uploads files and displays results. Everything else is just API calls to existing services."
